(Systematic Strategies Across Asset Classes / Risk Factor Approach to Investing and Portfolio Management )
- What is the economic rationale behind each strategy? (ex: why do momentum strategies work?)
 
- What is the best expression of each factor (ex: how to define "momentum"?)
 
- What is the best way to construct each strategy (ex: how much should allocate to each asset?)
 
- What is the best way to risk manage the strategy (ex: should you have position limits? what risks should you monitor?)
 
- How to make sure the strategy is robust (ex: how to backtest it? how to stress-test it?)
 
- How to assess the performance of each strategy when live (ex: which metrics should I look at?)
 
- Why are those strategies particularly attractive in the current environment? (ex: why they could complement a traditional portfolio?)
